Today, I decided to setup a simple website, most notably to display my [resume](/about) online outside of [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-mamie/), and maybe share some of my work sometimes.
Nothing too fancy.
That's why I went with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is freely available and open source.

For now, I'm simply using the default theme, which is called `minima`.
I have not really tweaked anything for now, but that will surely change in the future!

I use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host it in a [public repository](https://github.com/robinmamie/robinmamie.github.io), and made it available under the address [mamie.one](mamie.one).

Finally, I created a favicon using [this site](https://www.favicon.cc/).
